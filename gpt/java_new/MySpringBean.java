import statement, I will provide a refactored Java code snippet that would compile successfully. I'm going to assume that we want to import the `Autowired` annotation, which is commonly used in Spring applications.

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

public class MySpringBean {
    
    private final SomeOtherBean someOtherBean;

    @Autowired
    public MySpringBean(SomeOtherBean someOtherBean) {
        this.someOtherBean = someOtherBean;
    }

    // Other methods and logic go here
}

class SomeOtherBean {
    // Implementation of the class
}
