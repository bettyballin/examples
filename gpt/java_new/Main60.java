// Assuming the code snippet is already in a main method or another method, it should be able to compile without any changes.
// However, if we need to create a complete example, it would look something like this:

public class Main60 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.setProperty("java.security.policy", "path/to/your/security.policy");
        // Rest of your code here
    }
}
