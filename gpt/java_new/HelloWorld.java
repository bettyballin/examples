// This is not a Java code snippet, it is a security policy file snippet.
// Java code cannot be compiled from this snippet as it is not Java syntax.
// However, if you are looking to include security policy in your Java project,
// you should place this snippet into a '.policy' file and reference it when starting the JVM.

// For example, you would save the above snippet in a file named `myapp.policy`
// and then start your Java application with a security manager and this policy file:

// java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy==myapp.policy -jar your-signed-jar-file.jar

// Note: The double equals '==' is used to override the default policy configuration with the specified file.

// If you are looking for Java code, here's a simple example class:

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
