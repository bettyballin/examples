// The given snippet appears to be a part of a Java policy file rather than Java code.
// However, to provide a compilable Java code snippet that could relate to setting permissions, see below:

import java.io.FilePermission;
import java.net.SocketPermission;
import java.security.Permissions;

public class PolicyExample1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Permissions permissions = new Permissions();

        // allows reading and writing to a specific directory
        permissions.add(new FilePermission("/path/to/allowed/folder/-", "read,write"));

        // allows connections to local port 8080
        permissions.add(new SocketPermission("localhost:8080", "connect,listen,accept"));

        // allows connections to local port 3306
        permissions.add(new SocketPermission("localhost:3306", "connect,listen,accept"));

        // default permissions (you can adjust or remove these as necessary)
        // ... apply default permissions or other permissions as needed

        // Example usage of permissions
        // Note: Actual security checks would be performed by the JVM during runtime
        // based on the security policy in place and the context in which this code is executed.
