// This is a valid Java method. However, without context such as the class it belongs to and whether it properly overrides a method from a superclass or interface, it's not possible to refactor it for successful compilation in isolation. If it's intended to override a method from the SecurityManager class, it would need to be placed within a subclass of SecurityManager. Here is an example of how it might look within a subclass:

public class CustomSecurityManager1 extends SecurityManager {
    @Override
    public void checkPackageAccess(String pkg) {
        // don't allow the use of the reflection package
        if (pkg.equals("java.lang.reflect")) {
            throw new SecurityException("Reflection is not allowed!");
        }
        // Call to super is necessary if you want to keep the checks from the default implementation
        super.checkPackageAccess(pkg);
    }
}
