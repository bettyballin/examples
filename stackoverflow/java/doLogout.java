// The provided snippet is not valid Java code. It appears to be HTML with an Expression Language (EL) statement.
// As a developer, I would include it in a JSP or an HTML file, not a Java class. If you need to refactor this into a Java servlet or similar, you would handle the logout process programmatically.

// Example of a Java method to handle logout in a servlet:
public void doLogout(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
    HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);
    if (session != null) {
        session.invalidate();
    }
    response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + "/logoutSuccessfulPage.jsp");
}
