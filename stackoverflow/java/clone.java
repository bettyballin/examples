// Java does not support explicit copy constructors like C++, so there's no direct equivalent code.
// However, we can create a Java class and provide a method to clone the object.

class MyClass {
    // Suppose MyClass has some properties. We would clone them in the clone method.
    
    // Constructor
    public MyClass() {
        // Initialize your object here
    }
    
    // Copy method (similar to a copy constructor in C++)
    public MyClass(MyClass other) {
        // Copy properties from 'other' to the new instance
    }

    // Override the clone method from the Object class
    @Override
    public MyClass clone() {
        // Implement the clone logic here
        // For example, use the copy method we created
        return new MyClass(this);
    }
    
    // Assignment is not directly applicable in Java like in C++, but you can provide a method to copy properties.
    public void assign(MyClass other) {
        // Copy properties from 'other' to this instance
    }
}
