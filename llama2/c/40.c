This is not C code, it appears to be C# code. Here is the corrected C# code:

sharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a new AES algorithm with all-zero IV
        var aesAlgorithm = Aes.Create();
        aesAlgorithm.IV = new byte[16];
    }
}
