// The given code seems to be a mix of Java and Maven dependency declaration. 
// Below is the corrected Java code that can be executed.

public class Temp2680 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}


To actually utilize the Thymeleaf dependency, you would typically include it in a `pom.xml` file if using Maven for a Spring Boot project. Here's an example `pom.xml` snippet for reference:

xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.thymeleaf.extras</groupId>
    <artifactId>thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.4.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>


Make sure to include this dependency in your `pom.xml` if you're working on a Spring Boot project and want to use Thymeleaf with Spring Security.
