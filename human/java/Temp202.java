Note: The original code snippet appears to be a mix of Java and Spring Security XML configuration. Java code cannot execute XML directly. For a fully functional program, the Spring Security configuration should be placed in an appropriate XML file, and the Java code should be separate. The provided Java code is a placeholder to make the Java class executable.
