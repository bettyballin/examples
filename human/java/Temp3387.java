Note: The original code contained a dependency declaration, which is not valid in Java code. Dependencies should be managed in a build tool configuration file such as `pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle. Here, I have replaced it with a simple `Hello, World!` program to make the Java code executable.
