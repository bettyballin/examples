This is not C code, it's Swift code. Here is the corrected Swift code:

swift
let transportWrapper: SecureTransportWrapper = Unmanaged<SecureTransportWrapper>.fromOpaque(connection).takeUnretainedValue()


If you need C code, please provide the actual C code, not Swift code. I'll be happy to help you make it executable.
