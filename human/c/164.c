I'm happy to help, but I need to clarify that the provided code is not C code, but rather a Go build command and its output. The output appears to be a stack smashing detection error.

However, I can provide a C code example that demonstrates a similar stack overflow vulnerability:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void vulnerable_function(char *input) {
    char buffer[16];
    strcpy(buffer, input);
}

int main() {
    char input[] = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA";
    vulnerable_function(input);
    return 0;
}
