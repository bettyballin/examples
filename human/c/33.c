The code you provided is not C code, it appears to be a snippet of output from a Linux command, possibly `cat /proc/self/maps`. This output shows the memory mapping of a process, specifically the stack region.

Here's a simple C program that can be compiled and executed:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
