I need the complete code to make it executable. However, I can provide a basic structure for you. Please fill in the rest of the code.



#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    const volatile unsigned char * cs = (const volatile unsigned char*) "cs_in";
    const volatile unsigned char * ct = (const volatile unsigned char*) "ct_in";

    // the rest of the code is the same

    return 0;
}
