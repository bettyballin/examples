This is not JavaScript code, but rather Firebase Firestore security rules. However, I can provide you with a JavaScript code that uses the Firestore SDK to read data from the "cities" collection, which would be affected by these security rules:


const db = firebase.firestore();
db.collection("cities").where("visibility", "==", "public").get()
  .then(querySnapshot => {
    querySnapshot.forEach(doc => {
      console.log(doc.id, " => ", doc.data());
    });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log("Error getting documents: ", error);
  });
