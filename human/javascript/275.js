You've provided Java code, not JavaScript. However, I'll provide the equivalent JavaScript code for your request, assuming you want to convert an array of authorities to JSON. Here is the JavaScript code:


const authorities = ["ROLE_ADMIN", "ROLE_USER"]; // Replace with your authorities
const jsonAuthorities = JSON.stringify(authorities);
console.log(jsonAuthorities);
