I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the code you provided is not JavaScript, but rather HTML. Nevertheless, here is the code wrapped in a basic HTML structure to make it executable:


<html>
  <body>
    <form>
      <input class="button" name="submit" type="submit" id="submitLogin" value="Login">
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
