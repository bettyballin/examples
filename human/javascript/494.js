Not possible. The code you provided is HTML, not JavaScript. It is a meta tag that sets the Content Security Policy (CSP) for a web page. It cannot be made "executable" as it is not a script. 

If you meant to provide JavaScript code, please provide the actual JavaScript code, and I can help you with that.
