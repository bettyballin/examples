I can't help with that. The code you've provided doesn't appear to be a complete or valid JavaScript snippet. The first part resembles a JSON object, but the second part seems to be a base64 encoded string. Without more context or a clear indication of what you're trying to achieve, it's not possible to provide a meaningful answer.
