// This code is not JavaScript, it's PHP. However, I'll provide the corrected PHP code:

<?php
App::uses('AppModel', 'Model');

class Booking extends AppModel {

    public function getUserInfo(){
        $this->bindModel(
            array('belongsTo' => array(
                'Trainer' => array(
                    'className' => 'User',
                    'foreignKey' => 'to_user'
                ),
                'Participant' => array(
                    'className' => 'User',
                    'foreignKey' => 'user'
                )
            ))
        );
        return $this->find('all');
    }
}


Note: This is a PHP code using CakePHP framework, it's not possible to make it executable in JavaScript. If you need to convert it to JavaScript, it would require a complete rewrite using a JavaScript framework or library that provides similar functionality.
