This is not JavaScript code, it's a Struts2 configuration snippet in XML format. However, I can help you convert it to a JavaScript object:


const action = {
  name: "myAction",
  class: "myActionClass",
  interceptors: [
    {
      name: "defaultStack",
      params: {
        "csp.disabled": true
      }
    }
  ]
};
