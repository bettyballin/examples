I'm happy to help you, but I need to point out that the code you provided is a mix of PHP and HTML, and it's not executable as is. However, I can help you create a JavaScript code that is executable.

Here is the modified code:


alert('test');


Please note that the original code you provided was trying to set a Content Security Policy (CSP) using PHP headers, which is not relevant to JavaScript execution. If you want to test the CSP headers, you'll need to use a server-side language like PHP or a tool like curl to set the headers. If you want to test the JavaScript code, you can use the modified code I provided above.
