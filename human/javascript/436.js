This is not JavaScript code, it appears to be a snippet of XML configuration for ASP.NET. To make it executable, it would need to be part of a larger ASP.NET project. 

However, if you're looking to make a JavaScript file executable, you would typically do so by including it in an HTML file via a script tag or by running it in a Node.js environment.

If you're looking for an example of how to include JavaScript in an HTML file:

html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="yourjavascriptfile.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>


If you're looking to run JavaScript in a Node.js environment:


// yourjavascriptfile.js
console.log('Hello, World!');


Then run it with Node.js:

bash
node yourjavascriptfile.js
