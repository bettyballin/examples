// No executable code can be generated from a Firebase Storage security rules snippet.
// However, here is a JavaScript code that uses the Firebase Storage SDK to interact with the storage bucket:

const firebase = require('firebase/app');
const storage = require('firebase/storage');

firebase.initializeApp({
  apiKey: '<API_KEY>',
  authDomain: '<AUTH_DOMAIN>',
  projectId: '<PROJECT_ID>'
});

const storageRef = storage.storage().ref('friendlychat-6e4c3.appspot.com');

// Use storageRef to interact with the storage bucket, e.g. upload or download files.
