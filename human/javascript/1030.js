// This is not JavaScript code, it appears to be XML or a configuration file for a framework like Struts.

// However, if you're looking to create a JavaScript object that mirrors this structure, here's an example:

const interceptorRef = {
  name: "csp",
  params: [
    { name: "disabled", value: false },
    { name: "enforcingMode", value: false }
  ]
};
