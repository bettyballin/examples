Not possible. I can only provide text-based code, not executable code. However, I can provide the code that can be copied and pasted into an HTML file to make it executable:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src="https://maps-api-ssl.google.com/maps/api/js?libraries=places"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your map will be rendered here -->
  <div id="map"></div>
  <script>
    // Your JavaScript code here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
