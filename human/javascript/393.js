This code is not JavaScript, it's a Firebase Realtime Database security rules configuration file, written in JSON. However, I can provide you with a JavaScript code that sets up the same security rules using the Firebase JavaScript SDK:


var firebase = require('firebase');

firebase.initializeApp({
  // Your Firebase project configuration
});

var db = firebase.database();
var rules = {
  "rules": {
    "$uid": {
      ".read": "auth.uid == $uid",
      ".write": "auth.uid == $uid"
    }
  }
};

db.ref('/.settings/rules').set(rules);
