This code is already executable as CSS styles. However, I assume you want to make it executable as a JavaScript code snippet that applies these styles to HTML elements. Here is the JavaScript code:


document.getElementById("sample").style.margin = "10px";
document.getElementById("output").style.margin = "10px";
