Here is the executable code:

csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Globalization;

public class AesManagedCtr : Aes
{
    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    public static void Main()
    {
        Test();
    }
}


Note that I added a `Main` method to make the code executable. You can run this code in a C# environment to test the `AesManagedCtr` class.
