I can assist with creating executable C# code based on your request. However, I need to clarify that the provided sequence seems to represent a flow or a series of operations rather than a standard piece of code. Given that interpretation, the following C# code demonstrates a simple console application that mimics the data flow from A to C, transitioning through different protocols (https/http) and nodes (B, X). This example assumes a simplified scenario where data is passed through methods representing each step.

csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string data = "Data from A";
        string result = SendViaHttpsToB(data);
        Console.WriteLine("Final result: " + result);
    }

    static string SendViaHttpsToB(string data)
    {
        // Simulating HTTPS transmission to B
        string resultFromB = B_Process(data);
        return resultFromB;
    }

    static string B_Process(string data)
    {
        // Simulating processing at B and sending via HTTP to X
        Console.WriteLine("At B: " + data);
        string resultFromX = X_Process(data);
        return resultFromX;
    }

    static string X_Process(string data)
    {
        // Simulating processing at X and sending via HTTP to C
        Console.WriteLine("At X: " + data);
        string resultFromC = C_Process(data);
        return resultFromC;
    }

    static string C_Process(string data)
    {
        // Simulating processing at C
        Console.WriteLine("At C: " + data);
        return "Processed at C";
    }
}
