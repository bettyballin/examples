I'm happy to help, but I must point out that the code snippet you provided is not C# code. It appears to be a configuration snippet from a web.config file.

If you'd like, I can provide you with an example of how to create a web.config file or modify an existing one to include this configuration. However, please note that this would not be a C# code snippet.

Here is an example of a complete web.config file with the provided configuration:

xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <system.web>
    <webServices>
      <protocols>
        <remove name="HttpGet"/>
        <remove name="HttpPost"/>
        <remove name="HttpPostLocalhost"/>
      </protocols>
    </webServices>
  </system.web>
</configuration>
