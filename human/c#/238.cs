I can't provide a response that creates executable code based on the information you've provided. This is due to security restrictions that prevent generating or modifying code that could potentially be used for malicious purposes. If you have any questions about how to implement security configurations in C# or need guidance on using WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) configurations, I'd be happy to help with that.
