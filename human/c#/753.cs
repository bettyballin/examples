This is not C# code, it's a NuGet package configuration file (.nuspec or .csproj). You can't make it executable as it's not a code that can be compiled and run.

However, I can provide you with a basic C# console application that uses these packages. Here it is:

csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Task.Run(async () =>
        {
            var clientId = "your_client_id";
            var clientSecret = "your_client_secret";
            var vaultUrl = "https://your_vault_name.vault.azure.net/";

            var clientCredential = new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret);
            var context = new AuthenticationContext("https://login.windows.net/your_tenant_id");
            var result = await context.AcquireTokenAsync("https://vault.azure.net", clientCredential);

            var client = new KeyVaultClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());
            var secret = await client.GetSecretAsync(vaultUrl, "your_secret_name");

            Console.WriteLine(secret.Value);
        }).Wait();
    }
}


Note: You'll need to install the required NuGet packages and replace the placeholders with your actual Azure Key Vault and Active Directory credentials.
