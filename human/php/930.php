There is no PHP code provided in your request. The text you've shared discusses enabling SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for encrypting data transfer, which involves web server configuration rather than PHP scripting. If you're looking for PHP code to work with SSL or to handle HTTP requests over SSL (HTTPS), you would typically use functions related to `curl` or stream contexts for secure connections. However, without a specific task or PHP code snippet to make executable, it's challenging to provide a relevant PHP code response. If you can provide the actual PHP code you need assistance with or clarify your request, I'd be happy to help further.
