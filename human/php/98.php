This is not PHP code, it appears to be Apache configuration directives. However, I can provide you with a PHP code that achieves similar functionality:


<?php
$allowed_ip = '199.166.210.1';
$visitor_ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];

if ($visitor_ip !== $allowed_ip) {
    header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');
    exit;
}
?>
