This is not PHP code, it appears to be Apache configuration code. PHP is a server-side scripting language, whereas this code is used to configure the Apache web server.

As this is not PHP code, it cannot be made executable as PHP. However, I can provide you with a PHP script that will write this configuration to a file, which can then be included in your Apache configuration.


<?php
$config = '
LoadModule ibm_ssl_module modules/mod_ibm_ssl.so

<VirtualHost servername:443>
    SSLEnable
    ServerName servername
    SSLClientAuth None
    ErrorLog /servername/conf/ssl/logs/https-error_log
    RewriteEngine On
    Include conf/vanity_rules/vanity_rewrite_rules.conf
    KeyFile /servername/conf/ssl/yourkey.kdb
</VirtualHost>
';

file_put_contents('apache_config.conf', $config);
?>
