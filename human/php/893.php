This is not PHP code, it's Android XML layout code. PHP is a server-side scripting language and is not used for Android app development.

However, if you want to make it a PHP executable code, it's not possible as it's a different programming language and framework. But if you want to display a similar HTML output using PHP, here is an example:


&lt;?php
echo '&lt;p style="font-size:22px; margin:15px;"&gt;Token&lt;/p&gt;';
