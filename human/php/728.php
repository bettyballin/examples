This is not PHP code, it's Objective-C code for iOS development. However, I can provide you with the equivalent code in PHP, but it won't be executable as it's a different programming language and environment. Here's the PHP code:


// Not applicable, as this is an iOS-specific method
// However, a similar approach in PHP would be:

class DocumentInteractionController {
    public function getViewControllerForPreview() {
        return $this;
    }
}
