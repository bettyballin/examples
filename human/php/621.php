You've provided Apache configuration code, not PHP code. However, I can help you convert this into a PHP script that accomplishes a similar task. Here is a PHP script that redirects requests to `download.php`:


<?php
$file = $_GET['file'];
if (isset($file)) {
    header('Location: download.php?file='.$file);
    exit;
}
?>


Please note that you would need to configure your server to direct requests to this PHP script, and ensure `download.php` handles file downloads securely. 

However, if you are looking to create a similar routing mechanism in PHP like the one in your Apache configuration, you might consider using a framework that supports routing, such as Laravel or Symfony, or a micro-framework like AltoRouter or FastRoute.

Here is a simple example using AltoRouter:


<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$router = new AltoRouter();

$router->map('GET', '/file/[*:file]', 'download.php?file=*', 'download_file');

$match = $router->match();

if ($match && is_callable($match['target'])) {
    call_user_func_array($match['target'], $match['params']);
} elseif ($match) {
    header("Location: {$match['target']}");
    exit;
} else {
    header("HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found");
    echo "Not Found";
}
?>


This would require you to adjust your `download.php` to accept a file parameter and handle the download accordingly. 

Remember, these examples assume you are using a server configuration that directs requests to your PHP script, and may require additional setup.
