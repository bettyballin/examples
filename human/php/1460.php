That is not PHP code, it is HTML code. However, here is a PHP script that includes the Crypto-JS library and makes it executable:



<?php

echo <<<HTML
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/4.0.0/crypto-js.min.js"></script>
<script>
    // Your Crypto-JS code here
</script>
HTML;

?>
