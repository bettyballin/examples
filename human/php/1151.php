This is not PHP code, it's a Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml). To make it executable, you don't need to modify it, you just need to run it with Docker Compose. 

However, if you're asking how to make a PHP script executable, that's a different story. 

If you meant to provide a PHP script and forgot to include it, please provide the PHP code, and I'll be happy to help.

If you're looking to make this Docker Compose file work with a PHP script, you'll need to create a Dockerfile that sets up a PHP environment and copies your PHP script into the container. Here's a basic example of a Dockerfile for PHP:

dockerfile
FROM php:7.4-fpm

# Set working directory to /var/www/html
WORKDIR /var/www/html

# Copy the PHP script into the container
COPY . /var/www/html/

# Make the PHP script executable
RUN chmod +x your_script.php

# Expose port 9000 for FPM
EXPOSE 9000

# Run the command to start FPM when the container launches
CMD ["php-fpm"]


And your docker-compose.yml would look something like this:

yml
version: '3'
services:
  php:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html


To run your PHP script, you would then use `docker-compose exec php php your_script.php` 

Please note that this is a very basic example. Your actual Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml might need to be more complex depending on your specific use case. 

Also, remember to replace `your_script.php` with the actual name of your PHP script. 

Please provide more details or the actual PHP script if you need further assistance.
