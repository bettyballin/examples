This is not SQL code, it appears to be VBA code. However, I can make it executable by wrapping it in a module. Here is the code:



-- There is no SQL code to make executable. The provided code is VBA.

-- However, if you're looking for a SQL query related to login functionality,

CREATE TABLE Users (
  Username VARCHAR(255),
  Password VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO Users (Username, Password) 
VALUES ('user123', 'pass123');

SELECT * FROM Users 
WHERE Username = 'user123' AND Password = 'pass123';
