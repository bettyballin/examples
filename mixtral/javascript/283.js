This code appears to be a Firestore security rule, not JavaScript. However, I'll provide the corrected and executable code for the security rule:



rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /userdata/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.query.id == resource.data.id &&
                     request.auth != null ||
                    (request.resource.data.email is string &&
                     request.resource.data.email.matches(request.query.email));
    }
  }
}
