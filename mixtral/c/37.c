I can help you make this code executable, but I want to emphasize that this code has several security issues and should not be used for any sensitive or production purposes.

Here is the modified code:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <openssl/aes.h>
#include <openssl/rand.h>

// main entrypoint
int main(void)
{
    unsigned char *ae_key = malloc(32);

    printf("Enter a 32-char key: ");

    // Read the input with fgets to avoid buffer overflow
    if (fgets((char *)ae_key, 33, stdin) == NULL || strlen((const char*)ae_key) != 32) {
        fprintf(stderr, "You didn't write a valid key\n");
        return -1;
    }

    uint64_t msg = 30849384302932039ULL;

    // Generate input with given length
    unsigned char *ae_input = malloc(100);

    snprintf((char *)ae_input, 100, "%lu", msg);

    /* init vector */
    unsigned char iv[AES_BLOCK_SIZE];

    RAND_bytes(iv, AES_BLOCK_SIZE);

    // Buffers for encryption and decryption
    size_t encrypted_len = 0;

    // Allocate enough memory to hold the output
    unsigned char *enc_out = malloc((strlen((const char*)ae_input)+ AES_BLOCK_SIZE));

    AES_KEY enc_key;

    /* Encryption */

    // Initialize the encryption key
    if (AES_set_encrypt_key(ae_key, 256, &enc_key) < 0){
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to set encrypt key\n");
        return -1;
    }

    AES_cbc_encrypt(ae_input, enc_out, strlen((const char*)ae_input), &enc_key, iv, AES_ENCRYPT);

    printf("Encrypted: %s\n", enc_out);

    free(ae_key);
    free(ae_input);
    free(enc_out);

    return 0;
}


Please note that I have fixed several issues:

* Added missing headers (`<stdlib.h>` and `<openssl/rand.h>`)
* Fixed `fgets` call
* Fixed `snprintf` call
* Fixed `AES_set_encrypt_key` call
* Added `AES_cbc_encrypt` call
* Added `free` calls to avoid memory leaks
* Fixed some formatting issues

Again, I want to emphasize that this code has several security issues and should not be used for any sensitive or production purposes. For example, it uses `fgets` to read a key, which is not secure, and it uses a fixed IV, which is not secure. Additionally, it uses `AES_cbc_encrypt`, which is not the recommended mode of operation for AES.
